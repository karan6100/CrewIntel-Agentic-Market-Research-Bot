#  CrewIntel: Agentic Market Research Bot

Welcome to the CrewIntel: Agentic Market Research Bot project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). It simulates a virtual team of domain-specific agents—such as Researchers, Analysts, and Reporters—that collaborate to extract valuable insights from public data sources with minimal human intervention.
This project demonstrates the power of Agentic AI workflows by leveraging LLMs and role-based agent behaviors to automate complex research tasks traditionally handled by human analysts.
